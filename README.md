# Kiirkha
I have created a website for a jewellery store called 'Kiirkha'. This was done utilising HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Most text used are random quotes from the internet or sample text which will be replaced with information and text the company will issue in the future.
The images used were found on google as a temporary measure and will be replaced with the company products in the near future.
